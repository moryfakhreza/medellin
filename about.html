            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p><strong>Medellin Syndicates, started from a group of remote people who have the determination to dominate Las Barancas. This group of people started a small business. Initially the group of businessmen were ex-convicts from Colombia who had the goal of controlling Las Barancas. They do not have many members, only a few people and 5 leaders who are commonly called "The Mad Hatter". Initially one of the leaders named Sergio Silimore wanted to continue his crime, because he himself was unable to continue his crime, so he created an organization called a "syndicate". In continuing his crime Sergio Silimore became a fugitive in Colombia, and he fled to the United States (SA).


                The National Crime Syndicate is the name given by the press to a loosely connected, multi-ethnic confederation of several American criminal organizations. Mostly composed of and led by the Colombia-American mafia and closely related Jewish gangs; to a lesser extent, it also involves other criminal organizations such as the Irish Mob and African-American organized crime groups. Hundreds of murders were committed by Murder, Inc. on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s.
                
                
                According to the writer on organized crime, the Syndicate was the brainchild of Johnny Torrio, and was founded or founded at the May 1929 conference in Pas Barancas. The National Crime Syndicate is a confederation of mainly Colombia and Jewish organized crime groups. throughout the United States.
                
                The media dubbed the enforcement arm of the Syndicate "Mad Hatter, Inc.", a Brooklyn mob gang that carried out assassinations in the 1930s and 1940s for various crime bosses. It is led by Sergio and Anastasia, who reports to commission members Harold, Yaheem and Oscar, and includes many well-known mobsters. (edited)

                In his biography of Mayer Little Man (1991), journalist Robert Lacey argues that the National Crime Syndicate never existed. "The idea of ​​the National Crime Syndicate is often confused with the Mafia. Yet they are not the same," perhaps referring to the American Mafia.
                
                Although many of its members were imprisoned, and some executed, the death of the organization is uncertain as to its origins. In the late 1940s, Mad Hatter Inc. and most of its non-kolombia components are dead. Some individuals, such as Lansky, continued to operate as affiliates of the kolombia group.</p>
