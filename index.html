            <p><strong>Medellin Syndicates started from a group of remote people who have the determination to dominate Las Barancas.</strong> This group of people started a small business. Initially the group of businessmen were ex-convicts from Colombia who had the goal of controlling Las Barancas. They do not have many members, only a few people and 5 leaders who are commonly called "The Mad Hatter".

In continuing his crime Sergio Silimore became a fugitive in Colombia, and he fled to the United States (SA).</p>
